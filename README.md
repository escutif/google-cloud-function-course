# Google Cloud Function Course

##  Starting a project

To start a new proyect in Google Cloud, we can go to the 
[Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) or create it from [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

## Creating a virtual environment
First whe have to intall 'python3-venv' with the folling command
```
sudo apt install python3-venv
```

Then, we exewcute the following command:
```
python3 -m venv venv
```

To activate the virtual enviroment we do:
```
source venev/bin/activate
```

In order to add new packages to our new virtual enviroment we create a file called 'requirements.txt' and execute the following command 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
